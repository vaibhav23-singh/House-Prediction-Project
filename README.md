## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that estimates house prices using historical housing data. Techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods may be applied. The project aims to showcase the end-to-end process of a real-world machine learning solution.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and metrics
- Making predictions on new data

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhav23-singh/House-Prediction-Project.git
   cd House-Prediction-Project
   ```

2. Install dependencies (recommended: use a virtual environment):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Set up Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

## Usage

- Run EDA and preprocessing scripts to understand and clean the data.
- Train models by executing the relevant Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
- Evaluate model performance and select the best model.
- Use the trained model to predict house prices for new or unseen data.

Example:
```bash
python train_model.py
python predict.py --input new_data.csv
```

## Data

The dataset typically includes features such as:
- Id 
- MSSubClass
- MSZoning
- LotArea
- LotConfig
- BldgType
- OverallCond

> **Note:** Ensure you have the appropriate dataset in the `data/` directory. Refer to the data provider's license and usage terms.

## Modeling

The project explores multiple regression algorithms and machine learning models. Feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization are performed to improve predictive accuracy. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² score.

## Results

Results and analysis will be shared in the `notebooks/` or `results/` directory. Visualizations and key findings from the EDA will also be included.

## Contributing
